# truffle-basic
Basic truffle project set up as I like it.

## Local Setup
Ensure you have truffle intalled:
https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation/

Then:
npm install

Create a .env file, e.g.:
ETHEREUM_NETWORK="goerli"
INFURA_API_KEY = "...."
SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY = "...."

events.js needs this also:
DEMO_CONTRACT = "0x5cA6b84Eef98994B6FD7020F9EA3cCDe6F12aBC0"

You are good to go!
